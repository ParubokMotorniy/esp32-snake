The program runs the classic apple-collecting "Snake" game on *Freenove Development Kit for ESP32-S3-WROOM* kit.      
In reality, it also played the DOOM music while doing so, but one can really plug in any track.    

Dependencies include:   
+ Standard Ardunino headers
+ *LVGL* library
+ *TFT_eSPI* library
+ *ESP32-audioI2S-master* library
+ A couple of libraries from [Espressif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json)

The project had better be built through Arduino IDE, as it used to be originally.
